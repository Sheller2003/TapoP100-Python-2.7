# PyP100

PyP100 is a Python library for controlling many of the TP-Link Tapo devices including the P100, P105, P110 plugs and the L530 and L510E bulbs.


## Installation

For python 3:

```bash
  pip install PyP100
```

For Python 2:

Download or clone this reposetory and copy the Folder PyP100 to your Lib folder of your python installation e.g. /usr/bin/python2.7/Lib/PyP100

Next to the folder are the modules requests and pycryptodome required (both are provided via pip for python 2.7)
```bash
  pip install requests
```
```bash
  pip install pycryptodome
```
Hint: To ensure the copyed folder is included correctly restart your system.

## Usage

#### Plugs - P100, P105 etc.
```python
from PyP100 import PyP100

p100 = PyP100.P100("192.168.X.X", "email@gmail.com", "Password123") #Creates a P100 plug object

p100.handshake() #Creates the cookies required for further methods
p100.login() #Sends credentials to the plug and creates AES Key and IV for further methods

p100.turnOn() #Turns the connected plug on
p100.turnOff() #Turns the connected plug off
p100.toggleState() #Toggles the state of the connected plug

p100.turnOnWithDelay(10) #Turns the connected plug on after 10 seconds
p100.turnOffWithDelay(10) #Turns the connected plug off after 10 seconds

p100.getDeviceInfo() #Returns dict with all the device info of the connected plug
p100.getDeviceName() #Returns the name of the connected plug set in the app
```

#### Bulbs - L530, L510E etc.
```python
from PyP100 import PyL530

l530 = PyL530.L530("192.168.X.X", "email@gmail.com", "Password123")

l530.handshake() #Creates the cookies required for further methods
l530.login() #Sends credentials to the plug and creates AES Key and IV for further methods

#All the bulbs have the same basic functions as the plugs and additionally allow for the following functions.
l530.setBrightness(50) #Sets the brightness of the connected bulb to 50% brightness
l530.setColorTemp(2700) #Sets the color temperature of the connected bulb to 2700 Kelvin (Warm White)
l530.setColor(30, 80) #Sets the color of the connected bulb to Hue: 30Â°, Saturation: 80% (Orange)
```

#### Energy Monitoring - P110
```python
from PyP100 import PyP110

p110 = PyP110.P110("192.168.X.X", "email@gmail.com", "Password123")

p110.handshake() #Creates the cookies required for further methods
p110.login() #Sends credentials to the plug and creates AES Key and IV for further methods

#The P110 has all the same basic functions as the plugs and additionally allow for energy monitoring.
p110.getEnergyUsage() #Returns dict with all of the energy usage of the connected plug
```
